    </h1>
    <p>
        In this introductory course, you'll learn the essential concepts of algorithms, focusing on
        problem-solving techniques, flowchart design, and pseudocode. Weâ€™ll start by breaking down
        complex problems into manageable steps, visualizing solutions using flowcharts, and writing
        clear pseudocode to represent your logic. This foundational course is designed to prepare
        you for programming in Python or any other language by building strong algorithmic thinking skills.

    </h1>
    <p>
        This class is held weekly and focuses on solving physics problems. Each week, students
        complete a set of assigned problems. After reviewing the submissions, common issue are
        idenfied, and challenging or frequently requested problems are thoroughly sloved and 
        exlpained. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and address students' difficulies.
